# Dog breed classifier

In this notebook, I have implemented a dog breed classifier using a [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) and [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning). A function in the end of this notebook checks an image, responds whether it is an image of a dog / a human (or neither) and shows the most similar dog breeds.  

Please see the [Jupyter notebook file](Dog_breed_classifier.ipynb) in this repository.
